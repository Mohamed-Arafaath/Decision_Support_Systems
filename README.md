Project Title:
Gun Violence Data Warehouse: Constructing a Decisive Framework for In-Depth Analysis and Insights in Decision Support Databases

Motivation:
The Gun Violence Data Warehouse project aimed to provide a platform for comprehensive analysis of gun violence incidents in the United States. It sought to understand crime gravity across different parameters such as age groups, gun types, statuses, and years.

1. Part 1 - Datawarehouse Building:
Data Understanding and Pre-processing:
- Thorough exploration and preprocessing ensured data quality and integrity.

Implementation:
- Data Integration: Integrated diverse data sources into a cohesive schema.
- Data Processing: Loaded data into database tables and optimized the population process.

Populating the Database:
- Explored methods and optimized data population process.


2. Part 2 - SSIS Solution:
Utilized Visual Studio 2019 to create SSIS packages:
- Assignment - 0: Extracted data from database to a flat file.
- Assignment - 1: Loaded data from flat file to database.
- Assignment - 2: Transformed and loaded data into a new table.


3. Part 3 - Multidimensional Data Analysis:
- Established a connection with Database 
- Created views.
- Defined dimensions.

MDX Query:
- Assignment - 0 to 3: Created MDX queries for time, geography, gun type, and age group.

Dashboard - Power BI Solution:
Created a dynamic crime analysis dashboard using Power BI:
- Assignment - 4: Stacked bar chart illustrating crime gravity for stolen and non-stolen guns.
- Assignment - 5: Donut chart showing the distribution of gun status and crime gravity.

Conclusion:
The project iteratively explored methods to build a comprehensive data warehouse. Utilized Microsoft SQL Server, SSIS, MDX queries, and Power BI to analyze gun violence incidents effectively, contributing to a better understanding of crime patterns in the United States.
